### Proficiency: {{ number_of_stars }}

{{ tips_and_suggestions_to_improve }}
```

`number_of_stars` here must be formatted as `***` for Acceptable (3). You absolutely MUST follow this template, as the system will look for these specific strings as shown below to determine the proficiency level for the student.

- Exemplary (5): `### Proficiency: *****`
- Accomplished (4): `### Proficiency: ****`
- Acceptable (3): `### Proficiency: ***`
- Needs Improvement (2): `### Proficiency: **`
- Beginner (1): `### Proficiency: *`

If the template includes `### Proficiency: ***`, the system will automatically assess the student as having met the Acceptable (3) level of proficiency.
