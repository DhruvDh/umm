## Quantitative Reasoning SLO - Algorithmic solutions

Objective: Construct appropriate algorithmic solutions to computational problems

Rubric:

- Exemplary (5): For a given computational problem, student is consistently able to construct an optimal algorithm to correctly solve the problem, often demonstrating creativity in the solution.

- Accomplished (4): For a given computational problem, student is able to construct an algorithm that is appropriate and correctly solves the problem. The algorithm(s) used may be novel, simple, or an application of known / previously developed algorithms.

- Acceptable (3): For a given computational problem, student selects an appropriate algorithm, but does not incorporate it into a complete and correct solution to the problem.

- Needs Improvement (2): For a given computational problem, student is often unable to select and use an appropriate algorithm to solve the problem.
-
- Beginner (1): Student does not demonstrate ability to select or use an algorithm to solve the problem.

## Feedback Guidelines

1. `number_of_stars` in the template must be formatted as described below. You absolutely MUST follow this template, as the system will look for these specific strings as shown below to determine the proficiency level for the student.

   - Exemplary (5): `### Proficiency: *****`
   - Accomplished (4): `### Proficiency: ****`
   - Acceptable (3): `### Proficiency: ***`
   - Needs Improvement (2): `### Proficiency: **`
   - Beginner (1): `### Proficiency: *`

   If the template includes `### Proficiency: ***`, the system will automatically assess the student as having met the Acceptable (3) level of proficiency.

2. The snippets you include as described in the template must not be the entire submission, but rather a specific section of the submission that you are providing feedback on.

3. Include as many snippets and feedback sections as you feel are necessary to provide a comprehensive review.
