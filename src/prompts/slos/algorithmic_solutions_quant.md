## Quantitative Reasoning SLO - Algorithmic solutions

Objective: Construct appropriate algorithmic solutions to computational problems

Rubric:

- Exemplary (5): For a given computational problem, student is consistently able to construct an optimal algorithm to correctly solve the problem, often demonstrating creativity in the solution.

- Accomplished (4): For a given computational problem, student is able to construct an algorithm that is appropriate and correctly solves the problem. The algorithm(s) used may be novel, simple, or an application of known / previously developed algorithms.

- Acceptable (3): For a given computational problem, student selects an appropriate algorithm, but does not incorporate it into a complete and correct solution to the problem.

- Needs Improvement (2): For a given computational problem, student is often unable to select and use an appropriate algorithm to solve the problem.
-
- Beginner (1): Student does not demonstrate ability to select or use an algorithm to solve the problem.

## Feedback template

```template
## Algorithmic Solutions - {{ Feedback_title }}

{{ Feedback }}

## Proficiency: {{ number_of_stars }}
```

You absolutely MUST follow this template, as the system will look for a specific string as follows to determine the number of stars per your assessment:

- Exemplary (5): `## Proficiency: *****`
- Accomplished (4): `## Proficiency: ****`
- Acceptable (3): `## Proficiency: ***`
- Needs Improvement (2): `## Proficiency: **`
- Beginner (1): `## Proficiency: *`
