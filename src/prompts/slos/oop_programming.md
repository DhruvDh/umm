## Basic Programming SLO - Object-Oriented Programming

Objective: Write a program applying principles of object-oriented programming

Rubric:

- Exemplary (5): Program demonstrates a strong understanding of object-oriented principles, applying object-oriented principles and design patterns correctly and considering additional perspectives, e.g., concurrency, reliability, scalability, efficiency, modularity, extensibility, and ethics.

- Accomplished (4): Program applies principles of object-oriented programming well, demonstrated by class design with appropriate uses of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, leading to well-organized code.

- Acceptable (3): Program applies principles of object-oriented programming reasonably well in most parts, but there are some instances where abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, or polymorphism could be better applied to improve the design and structure.

- Needs Improvement (2): Program attempts to use object-oriented principles, but sometimes fails to apply them appropriately / effectively. For example, all core principles are used, but are not used correctly or effectively. Alternatively, a student may excel in applying one or more object-oriented principles but has consistent difficulties with the others.

- Beginner (1): Program does not demonstrate a grasp of object-oriented principles, and the code lacks any meaningful application of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, or polymorphism.

### Proficiency: {{ number_of_stars }}

{{ tips_and_suggestions_to_improve }}
```

`number_of_stars` here must be formatted as `***` for Acceptable (3). You absolutely MUST follow this template, as the system will look for these specific strings as shown below to determine the proficiency level for the student.

- Exemplary (5): `### Proficiency: *****`
- Accomplished (4): `### Proficiency: ****`
- Acceptable (3): `### Proficiency: ***`
- Needs Improvement (2): `### Proficiency: **`
- Beginner (1): `### Proficiency: *`

If the template includes `### Proficiency: ***`, the system will automatically assess the student as having met the Acceptable (3) level of proficiency.
