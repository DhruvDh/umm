# umm

## Introduction

A java build tool for novices.

## Installation

You would need rust installed, ideally the nightly toolchain. You can visit https://rustup.rs/ to find out how to install this on your computer, just make sure you install the "nightly" toolchain instead of stable.

Once you are done, just type `cargo install --git=https://github.com/DhruvDh/umm.git` and it should compile and install it on your system.
